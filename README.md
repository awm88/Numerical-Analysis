# Numerical-Analysis
Stock Market prediction is one example of an analysis that can benefit from Linear
Regression. The purpose of this report is to create four other simulations to evaluate
the performance of Linear Regression on Random Generated Datasets before moving
on to the actual Stock Market predictions. 
Our recommendation for better modelling for stock market predictions is to
make further investigations to explore smaller time samples' effects by applying
techniques such as ARIMA, Multilayer Perceptron, and XGBoost.
